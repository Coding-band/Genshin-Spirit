	"story": "A nagamaki sword designed by one of Tatarasuna's inspectors.\nIt is said that the diagram is as simple and upright as that inspector was.\n\nFor a long time, before the introduction of the outlander technology that helped build the Mikage Furnace,\nTatarasuna smelted iron using the traditional \"Tatara Metalworking Method.\"\nAfter Mikoshi Nagamasa became the inspector, he was for a time obsessed with the grim loveliness of steel.\nHe thus consulted the similarly-inclined Vice Armory Officer Miyazaki for advice,\nWith the end result being this tough and simple sword, the Daitatara Nagamasa.\n\nAlthough he was only the foster son of the Mikoshi Clan, and although his foster mother had stained the reputation of the Mikoshi,\nAnd even though Mikoshi's only legitimate heir, Michihiro, abandoned him and disappeared,\nHis self-admitted stupidity and loyalty led him to cherish the Mikoshi name all the more.\nHe strove to enter the government and got rid of the family's bad reputation with his diligence and righteousness.\n\nWhen his yoriki Katsuragi was connected with but a single trace of misconduct, he had him executed without mercy.\nEver since then, the name of the sword and his title were changed forever.",
