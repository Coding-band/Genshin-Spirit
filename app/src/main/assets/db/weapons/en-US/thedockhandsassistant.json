	"story": "A once-popular tool during the days when Fontaine was more dependent on manual labor.\nThe blade might not have been strong enough for prolonged, intense use,\nBut it made up for this by allowing the blunt section to be broken off at the user's convenience.\n\nDock workers often used it to cut through thin materials and untie knotted cables.\nAlthough the use of this type of weapon was always heavily regulated and no blade never truly belonged to the user,\nIt was widely circulated under the tables, and was once hailed as the blade of the people.\nIt was perfect for self-preservation in less friendly natural environments, as well as for cutting paths through aquatic plants.\nLegend has it that many people also discovered new uses for it during the purge.\nAs society advanced and more regulations were put into place, this type of blade gradually ceased to appear in public.\n\nAlthough such blades were not owned by their wielders,\nThose who depended on them saw them as extensions of their limbs,\nAnd so they often inscribed their names onto the hilts and blades to avoid losing them.\nThe name inscribed on this blade belongs to one of Poisson's former mayors.",
