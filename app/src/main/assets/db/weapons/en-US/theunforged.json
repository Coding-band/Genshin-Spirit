	"story": "A long time ago, a dragon there was to be found in Liyue.\nNot a dragon that soared the skies, but one whose abode was the mountains.\nIndeed, this ancient dragon of stone was as large as the very mountains it called home.\n\nThe legends say that it slumbered in Nantianmen, seeming not at all unlike the surrounding hills.\nBut when it awakened, even the tiniest movement, or the slightest stretch...\nThat would cause the earth to tremble and shake.\nThen, Rex Lapis came before the dragon, seeking to stop the earth's quailing.\n\nThey say that for a long while, the land knew peace,\nAnd that Rex Lapis gained another comrade by his side.\n\nBut in the end, the union of dragons, gods and men was perhaps not to be...\n\nThe dragon was sealed in the bowels of the earth. Fearing the ire of the gods and the adepti,\nThe Geovishaps, who once heeded the trembling of the rock and wrought havoc alongside the dragon,\nFled into the roots of the mountains.\nBut as millennia passed, the dragon began to stir once again...\n\nThe legends hold that those who triumphed over the dragon stabbed this sword into the ground next to the giant tree that subdued the ancient dragon.\nAs one of the seals, monsters and malevolent mortals would be unable to touch it.\nIndeed, if the legends are true, only those with hearts as pure as clear mirrors could even come near it.\nYet, if those legends are true, how did this sword come to be lost?",
