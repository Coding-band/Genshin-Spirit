	"story": "The whole world flocks to the commercial port of Liyue, much to the city's pride.\nWith the tides of people also come exotic treasures.\nThis map, detailing the various seas surrounding the continent, is complete with undercurrents, hidden reefs, and wind directions.\nIt is said to be an exotic tome containing the knowledge, courage, and faith of pioneering explorers.\n\nThe title page of this book reads as follows:\n\"Love ye the sea breeze and the ocean currents, for it is the wind and water that carry the seafaring ones to their destination.\"\n\"Fear ye all the more that same sea breeze and those same ocean currents, for unbridled wind and water can tear apart even an iron vessel.\"\n\nTo woo the ocean and calm her temper, one must explore her every hidden reef, every prevailing wind, and every place which whales make their home.\nThese words appear in the yellowing pages of countless seafarers' notebooks, like an ode of infatuation with their lover's body.\n\nIn foreign lands, seasoned sailors refer to the ocean as their lover, and use female pronouns to address the cold, saline waters.\nPerhaps they do so because of the ocean's temperamentality, or its vast bosom. Or perhaps it is because they are drawn to the romance of sailing away on an adventure.\nLike the ocean, this chart answers to no master. Like the seafarers, it harbors the romantic dream of exploring every corner of the world.",
