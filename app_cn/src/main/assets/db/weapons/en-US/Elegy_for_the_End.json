When the Elemental Skills or Elemental Bursts of the character wielding this weapon hit opponents, that character gains a Sigil of Remembrance. This effect can be triggered once every 0.2s and can be triggered even if said character is not on the field. When you possess 4 Sigils of Remembrance, all of them will be consumed and all nearby party members will obtain the Millennial Movement: Farewell Song effect for 12s. Millennial Movement: Farewell Song increases Elemental Mastery by 100/125/150/175/200 and increases ATK by 20%/25%/30%/35%/40%. Once this effect is triggered, you will not gain Sigils of Remembrance for 20s. Of the many effects of the Millennial Movement, buffs of the same type will not stack.",
