	"story": "A blade that thirsts after fresh blood will be awakened by its scent.\nThose who possess, wield, and nourish it will keep killing.\nTill even a pure soul is blackened by bloodshed...\n\nThere once was a bright white knight, who longed ever for the path of justice.\nClad in burnished armor, a mirror-sheen sword hung from his hip.\nWherever there was injustice, man-eating beast, or fire in the distance,\nThe Knight would ride up in haste, to cut, slash, and pierce.\nFollowing the teachings of the Wolf Pup, who taught him chivalry, justice and swordsmanship,\nHe cut, slashed, and pierced them from head to toe...\nTill justice had run its course, and the monster moved no more.\n\n\"I began to lose myself in cutting, slashing, and piercing.\"\n\"When my blade's edge met my foe's flesh, it sent a tingle up my spine.\"\n\"Ah. This must be the feeling of justice getting its dues.\"\n\"As long as I cut, slash, and pierce the evil in this twisted world,\"\n\"Someday, someday, it shall all be cleansed.\"\n\n\"O, foolish knight, slaughter in the name of justice is slaughter still.\"\n\"Nay. Slaughter in the name of justice is justice.\"\n\nCut. Slash. Pierce. Thus will you see justice done!\nThough the white flowers the maidens offer you should be bloodied black, though your sword should no longer gleam bright,\nThough your fair countenance should turn hideous, and you should be forced to don an iron mask,\nThough those you defend cannot understand you, cease never!\n\nAnd so, the black-stained knight persisted on his path, pursuing monsters in the name of justice,\nUntil he came upon an ancient, ruined realm, where he discovered the ultimate injustice...",
